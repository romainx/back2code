The book *Think like a programmer*[^1] is interesting because it does not only focus on coding. One of the most interesting chapter is related to **general problem-solving techniques**. I found it so great, that I wanted to write down the rules, in order to remind me later these useful advices--cherry on the cake, they can be applied to almost every problem.

1. Always have a plan
2. Restate the problem
3. Divide the problem
4. Start with what you know
5. Reduce the problem
6. Look for analogies
7. Experiment
8. Donâ€™t get frustrated
