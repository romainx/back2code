# Introduction

In the frame of the [Hackaviz2020](https://github.com/ToulouseDataViz/Hackaviz2020) organized by the [ToulouseDataViz](https://toulouse-dataviz.fr/), I had to work on displaying weekends on a plot. And, this is not so easy for a novice ...

During this Hackaviz I've also discovered the Tidy dataframes for Time series called [`tsibble`](https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/) and its associated universe of **Tidy tools for time series**, [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org). I will use them here to display weekends.

# Finding Weekends

Let's start from an example, [`nycflights13`](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) containing all out-bound flights from NYC in 2013.
The first objective is to identify weekends turn the dataset into a `tsibble`.

```R
library(dplyr)
library(tsibble)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

flights <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(str_glue("{year}-{month}-{day}"))) %>%
  select(date, flight) %>%
  # Counting the number of distinct flights by date
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(flights = n_distinct(flight)) %>%
  # Computing the weekends by converting in weekday starting on monday to ease the cut
  mutate(weekend = wday(date, week_start = getOption("lubridate.week.start", 1)) > 5) %>%
  # Finally converting to a Tsibble
  as_tsibble(key = weekend, index = date) %>%
  arrange(date)
flights

# A tsibble: 365 x 3 [1D]
# Key:       weekend [2]
#   date       flights weekend
#   <date>       <int> <lgl>  
# 1 2013-01-01     747 FALSE  
# 2 2013-01-02     837 FALSE  
# 3 2013-01-03     820 FALSE  
# 4 2013-01-04     817 FALSE  
# 5 2013-01-05     653 TRUE   
# 6 2013-01-06     747 TRUE   
# 7 2013-01-07     841 FALSE  
# 8 2013-01-08     807 FALSE  
# 9 2013-01-09     802 FALSE  
#10 2013-01-10     833 FALSE  
# â€¦ with 355 more rows
```

# Plotting Weekends

To plot the weekends I did not want to use `geom_rect` like it is advised in some answers in SO since to use it it is required to define `xmin` and `xmax` what is tedious and require to build a specific non-tidy dataframe. Here is an approach using [`geom_tile`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_tile.html).

To do it I'm filling the tile according if it's a weekend or not so by using the variable `weekend` already computed (`x = date, fill = weekend`)
Then, some cosmetic adjustments on the `y` position of the tiles.

- `y = min(flights)`: to set the base of the tile not at zero
- `height = Inf`: to make them spread to the top of the chart.

```R
flights %>%
    # I'm filtering the data to make it more readable in the plot
    filter(date > ymd("2013-09-30")) %>%
    # Standard plot, the flights by day as a line
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = flights)) +
    geom_line(color = "Purple", size = 1.5, alpha = .7) +
    # Defining a special scale to fill weekends in grey
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("alpha", "grey")) +
    # And here is the trick!
    geom_tile(aes(
        x = date,
        y = min(flights),
        height = Inf,
        fill = weekend
    ), alpha = .4) +
    theme_minimal()
```

# Conclusion

According to this plot, it seems that there is less flights leaving the NYC airport in 2013. Let's check it with the help of the `tsibble`. I want to check for each quarter if the average number of flights by day is lower during the weekends.

```R
flights %>% 
  # Grouping by the key that is the weekend
  group_by_key() %>%
  # Summarising data by quarter of the year
  index_by(quarter = ~ yearquarter(.)) %>% 
  summarise(
    flights = mean(flights, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(quarter, weekend)

# A tsibble: 8 x 3 [1Q]
# Key:       weekend [2]
#   weekend quarter flights
#   <lgl>     <qtr>   <dbl>
# 1 FALSE   2013 Q1    844.
# 2 TRUE    2013 Q1    719.
# 3 FALSE   2013 Q2    877.
# 4 TRUE    2013 Q2    749.
# 5 FALSE   2013 Q3    887.
# 6 TRUE    2013 Q3    756.
# 7 FALSE   2013 Q4    869.
# 8 TRUE    2013 Q4    747.
```

And yes it's true the number of flights leaving the NYC airport in 2013 is lower during the weekend (`< 800`) than during the week (`> 800`).
