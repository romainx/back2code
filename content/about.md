My first contact with code was--like for a lot of people belonging to my generation--with **BASIC** on a CRT TV screen loading files from a tape recorder. Then I learned **C** and the great magical world of Objects with **Java**. But I was a bit upset by its growing complexity and the need to write a bunch of useless code.

After spending some time working more on **Excel** spreadsheets than coding, the simplicity of **Python** gives me a fresh wind and now I use it for almost everything. One of those things is *data science* and I've played--and also worked--a lot with its data ecosystem centered around *pandas* in *Jupyter notebooks*. I have also worked with its friend and competitor **R** and I must confess that, after a first disappointing experience, I come back to R with a great enthusiasm thanks to the awesome work done on the tidyverse — and on *RStudio* — by one of the data science superhero [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). After Batman vs. Superman this is Hadley vs. [Wes McKinney](http://wesmckinney.com/). Now, I’m working on a *Big Data Hadoop* platform (HDP), welcome back Java ... So I have started to learn **Scala**.

The topics that occupies me right now are:

* [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/interview/ben-treynor.html) (SRE). I will try to write some articles on this field of **operations**,
* [Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/). I’ve created a list of books [here](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/122960.Chaos_Engineering),
* Also learning Go ([Golang](https://golang.org/)), but just for fun,
* Now focus on [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
* Next step, Deep Learning.

I must be nostalgic since I love old languages and systems, and all these old stories of pioneers--I have a great list of books on that topic.

I'm also a big fan of **plain text** and the various editors dedicated to this simple but fundamental purpose. Obviously I love **Markdown**, I use it as much as I can, but unfortunately it is not--still--supported by Outlook.
